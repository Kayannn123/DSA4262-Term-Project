# DSA4262-Term-Project
# Prediction of m6A RNA Modifications from Direct RNA-Seq Data

## Project Overview
This project is part of **DSA4262 – Data Science in Genomics (AY2025)**.  
Our goal is to develop a machine learning method to **identify m6A RNA modifications** from direct RNA sequencing data and apply the model to SG-NEx cancer cell lines.  

- **Task 1:** Train and evaluate a machine learning classifier using training data (Hct116 cell line).  
- **Task 2:** Apply the best-performing model to five SG-NEx cancer cell lines (A549, Hct116, HepG2, MCF7, K562).
